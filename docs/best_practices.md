## tl;dr

- [x] Use feature branches, keep `main` or `master` clean
- [x] Commit small, focused changes often
- [x] Write clear commit messages ([how-to](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))
- [x] Always add unit tests for new code (test-driven development -> [guide](https://medium.com/@muirujackson/python-test-driven-development-6235c479baa2))

## Git commands

- [x] Quick start: skim the cheat-sheet in [here](git_commands.md) for the essentials. If curiosity (or FOMO) strikes, dive into the full deep‑dive: [here](REP_Course_GitGitlab_v1-1-2.pdf).

## Pull Requests

- [x] Why do we need it? https://www.hackerone.com/blog/why-you-should-use-pull-requests-developers-essential-tool
- [x] How to do that? See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCKdihvneS0.
- [x] Write clear commit messages ([how-to](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/))
- [x] Commit small, focused changes often
- [x] Always add unit tests for new code (test-driven development -> [guide](https://medium.com/@muirujackson/python-test-driven-development-6235c479baa2))

## Repository Organization

- [x] README.md for onboarding new team members into the project -> [guide](https://richardsondx.medium.com/step-by-step-guide-to-writing-better-documentation-to-improve-developer-onboarding-376a4a9181d).
- [x] Prefer a single repository for each project, especially if you are working solo. This keeps things simple and avoids confusion. Only consider splitting into multiple repositories if you have a large team and clear separation between project parts (e.g., backend vs frontend).
- [x] Provide a [Makefile](../Makefile.common.mak) to standardize common commands. Include targets such as install-all for environment setup, lint, test, and build to give new team members a single entry point for routine tasks.
- [x] Remove or archive old, unused, or deprecated projects in github.
- [x] Source code in `/src`, tests in `/tests`, examples or experiments in `/experiments`.
- [x] Document dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or `requirements.txt`.
- [x] Fill governance form in each project ([here](governance.md)).
- [x] Protect `main`/`master` branches if more than one person works on the same project ([branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule)).
- [x] Optional: Use [`git-lfs`](https://git-lfs.github.com/) for large files

## Main Branch & Versioning

- [x] The `main/master` branch is the single source of truth. All code should be merged here.
- [x] Avoid opening many branches at once, keep your branch structure simple and focused.
- [x] Use feature branches for specific changes, and delete them after merging.
- [x] Keep your version history clean by using [tags](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) for releases instead of long-lived branches.
- [x] Use the branch names like `feat/xxx-xxx`, `fix/xxx-xxx`, `refactore/xxx-xxx`, `docs/xxx-xxx`, etc. to folder the branches.

## Daily Workflow

- [x] `git pull` before work, `git push` after
- [x] Delete merged branches
- [x] Tag releases for tracking ([tagging guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging))
- [x] Never force-push shared branches
- [x] Optional: Use pre-commit hooks for formatting & linting [example1](https://codilime.com/blog/python-code-quality-linters/) and [example2](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/blog/python-linting-guide/)

## Coding Standards & Tooling

- [x] Optional: Use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for hooks
- [x] For notebooks, use [nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout) and spell checkers
- [ ] Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) for style. For that, use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for formatting, Lint with [pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/)/ [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/)/[Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/), and type checker with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Read [Three friends of the better code style](https://makimo.com/blog/three-friends-of-the-better-code-style-python/)).
- [x] Interactive scripts: [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) or [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/)

## Recommended Technologies

- [x] Testing: [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) / [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
- [x] CI: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- [x] Docs: [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/), [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- [x] Docs hosting: [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
